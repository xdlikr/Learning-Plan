# Apple AiDP ML Engineer — 6‑Month Skill‑Building Plan (Milestones + LeetCode + Resources)

**Goal:** Strengthen CS fundamentals, MLOps/infra, and GenAI engineering for product‑grade ML roles (e.g., Apple AiDP).  
**Time budget:** ~10–12 hrs/week (adjust up/down as needed).  
**Outputs:** Visible GitHub projects, deployed demos, and a tight interview story bank.

---

## How to Use This Plan
- **Daily (Mon–Fri)** → 45–60 min DSA (LeetCode).  
- **Project blocks (2–3×/week)** → 90–120 min each for hands‑on infra/GenAI work.  
- **Weekly review** → 30 min: track solved problems, commits, what to improve.  
- **Deliverables** are listed per milestone; host code in **public repos** when possible.

> Tables below use short entries; detailed instructions stay in bullet lists.
